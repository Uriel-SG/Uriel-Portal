The **Uriel Code** is a crypto-code created by Uriel-SG in the 2015.

- It's pretty easy, but useful if you need a quick encryption.
- It's easy to use without the application too if you understand how it works.

The **Uriel Portal** was born to contain the *Uriel Code*. 
Only the users signed up can use it.

To sign up, an UPK ("*Uriel Portal Key*") is needed.
